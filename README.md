# R_proj_reviewhelpness_Follow-or-not
A navie insight towards review helpfulness. 

This is a simple proj which tries to repeat the work of a paper in DSS. There are two parts of this simple proj, one for processing and the other is fuzzy matching. If you want to get the data sample, please download it from Google Drive:https://drive.google.com/file/d/13fg83xTAiwqygAdhMnZOrQ5ctAPCa-20/view?usp=sharing. As for the tax csv, feel free to ask me for the dataset :)
